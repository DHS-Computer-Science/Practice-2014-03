# Practice 2014 - 03: Report Card Time

## Background
Little hobbitses go to hobbit school in the Shire. They just finished a course,
which involved tea-making, meal-eating, nap-taking, and gardening. Based on the
following grading scale, assign each hobbit a letter grade based on their final
numerical course grade.
- A+: 97-100
- A: 90-96
- B+: 87-89
- B: 80-86
- C+: 77-79
- C: 70-76
- D+: 67-69
- D: 60-66
- F: 0-59

## Description

### Input
The input will begin with a single line containing just a whole number, n, of
the number of hobbits in the class, followed by n lines in the form a b, where a

given as a whole number.

### Output
For each test case, print out a list of every hobbits name and letter grade,
each on its own line. There should be no additional white space following
test cases.
